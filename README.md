# ProjectManagementSystem


## Project Title: Web Platform for Connecting Professionals with Projects

## Project Clients
- Dr. Basem Suleiman, School of Computer Science and Engineering UNSW

## Project Specializations
- Software development/Engineering
- Web Application Development

## Background
The goal of this project is to design and develop a Web platform that connects companies offering projects with potentially interested individuals who are willing to carry on project work.

## Requirements and Scope
Companies may create and choose to share projects with the public. Interested individuals (professionals) can search and request to join projects. The web application is responsive and accessible on mobile devices. The following are the core requirements that should be designed and implemented by the end of this project.

### Users
- Administrator users have the full privilege in the system and should be able to manage and oversee the platform.
- Users with different roles and responsibilities can create their account, login, and operate the system based on their roles and responsibilities.
- Users can edit/maintain their profiles.

### Company user
- A company can create/register their account and login.
- A company can edit their account by updating basic account information.
- A company can create a new project by providing project information.
- A company can view their project lists and its details (and filter it) and can edit any project information.
- A company can approve/reject individuals requested to join the project.
- A company can view/edit the list of professionals who are approved to join a project.
- A company can view list of all available projects (project lists) and can choose to see the details of any project with filters.
- A company can rate and recognize the participants who contributed to their projects at the end of the project.

### Professional user
- A professional (individual looking to join projects) can create/register their account and login.
- A professional can edit and update their account/project.
- A professional can search and browse list of available projects and refine the results with search filters.
- A professional can select to view the full details of any project from the search results.
- A professional can request to join/apply for a project of interest (this includes sharing relevant information from their profile).
- A professional receives a notification of their request to join a project.
- A profession can see the project page if they are approved by a company.
- A professional can rate their experience with the project when the project is completed.
- Upon successful completion, a professional can obtain a certificate of recognition from the company offering the project.
- Professional can browse list of achievements (completed projects and reviews).

## Knowledge and Skills Contained
- Familiarity with web application development (front-end and back-end)
  - Technology stack can be flexible â€“ e.g., MEAN stack.
- Familiarity with web development and testing frameworks and practices
- Familiarity with database design and management for storing data (e.g., NoSQL)
- Familiarity with UI/UX principles and implementation
- Familiarity with Agile software development methods, practices, and tools
- Familiarity with software testing, building, and deployment.

## Deliverables
- Project documentation including source code, system architecture and design, UI/UX, different types of testing, user manuals and guides, technical guides.
- Responsive Web application which is accessible on various devices, e.g., tablets and smartphones.


# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
You need a dir /9900fronted/my-react-app/node_modules containing all required modules
step1 cd .../9900fronted/my-react-app
step2 npm install

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).
